The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger immediately after a successful login or sign-up. This can lead to unexpected behavior if your application relies on the authentication state to proceed.

```javascript
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(user => {
  if (user) {
    // User is signed in.
    console.log('User signed in:', user);
    // ... your code to handle a successful login
  } else {
    // User is signed out.
    console.log('User signed out');
    // ... your code to handle user sign-out
  }
});
```

In some cases, the `user` object might remain `null` for a short period even after successful authentication. This can lead to race conditions or unexpected UI rendering issues.
